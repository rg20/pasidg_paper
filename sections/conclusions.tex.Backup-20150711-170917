\section{Conclusions}
We demonstrated that faster than real-time simulations can be achieved with high order discontinuous Galerkin methods that are computationally demanding. This is due to the efficient multi-rate time integration technique and the carefully tuned algorithms on modern many-core hardware architectures such as GPUs.   We validated the numerical model and implementation with  2004 Indian Ocean tsunami data. We compared the overall runtime performance of CUDA, OpenCL, OpenMP threading models through OCCA framework.
