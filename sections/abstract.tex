Modeling tsunami wave propagation is of great importance in developing warning systems and disaster management planning. %High fidelity models require large scale computations. The requirement of running such simulations many times in stochastic analysis demands efficient and scalable simulators. 
High fidelity models require repeated simulations consisting of large scale computations, demanding efficient and scalable simulators. In this paper, we consider two dimensional shallow water equations for modeling tsunami wave phenomenon, a high order discontinuous Galerkin method for numerical simulations, and efficient algorithms that are tailored for SIMD architecture seen in modern GPUs. By adopting a physically motivated multi-rate time stepping method and carefully designed implementations, we can simulate a realistic 10 hrs of 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami  in one minute on a single GPU workstation. We further demonstrate the cost of using the developed simulator with 2011 Japan tsunami simulation in global ocean. We use OCCA, an extensible multi-threading API that allows us to run the simulation on the many computing hardware architectures supporting any of CUDA, OpenCL, or OpenMP programming models.
